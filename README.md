This is a Frontend Mentor Challenge. It is called QR code component https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H

This will be my first challenge with many many more to come.

When this is completed, I will update the link to the live version via netlify.


### Links

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Continued development

I had an issue centering the card on the center of the screen. I tried multiple ways by changing where my flexbox attributes were placed. Of course, that would change too much of the content. Eventually, I asked for help from a facebook group and posted a codepen. I will update if I figure it out, or if it was figured out by someone else.
