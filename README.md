This is a Frontend Mentor Challenge. It is called QR code component https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H

This will be my first challenge with many many more to come.

When this is completed, I will update the link to the live version via netlify.


### Links

- Live Site URL: [https://taupe-souffle-95e5fb.netlify.app](https://taupe-souffle-95e5fb.netlify.app)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Continued development

I had an issue centering the card on the center of the screen. I tried multiple ways by changing where my flexbox attributes were placed. Of course, that would change too much of the content. Eventually, I asked for help from a facebook group and posted a codepen. I will update if I figure it out, or if it was figured out by someone else. 

-- Edit I figured it out. Someone did reply to my post, however, they worte down what I had inside the body tag. I figured out that my page-container tag did not include the code that Frontend Mentor had put into the HTML. Definitely something that I will not soon forget.
